				I'm currently studying in grade 12 and is looking to be a computer science major (Yes I'm a femboy but not because I like computers).
				I'm not really of a social person and I'm not really of an assertive person either. I mostly spend my time at home either playing video games or doing my hobbies that I stated eariler.
				I do really like cosplaying, Although I don't have much money for me to spend on it.
				That's all I want you to know about me.

		<h2 class="subtopic">Questions you might have about me</h2>
		<p class="walloftext">Here are some questions you might (or might not) ask me. I put this here so you can get to know me better or something idk</p>
		<div class="walloftext">
			<h3>Q | People/Artists/Group that you like and inspires your work?</h3>
			<p>A | I'm inspired mostly by Japanese artists like ADO, HoneyWorks, fripSide, etc. But people in music making communities do inspires me as well.</p>
			
			<h3>Q | Why did you start making a music Youtube channel?</h3>
			<p>
				A | Back when I started. I actually wanted to make an all in one Youtube channel with gaming content and Vlogs. 
				But due to my limited hardware I had back then. I couldn't record my gameplay. So I only did music content due to its low hardware requirements.
				After doing that for a while, I kinda forgot about other stuff and just kept making music.
			</p>

			<h3>Q | After making music for 6 years, Do you think that you can make music at a professional level?</h3>
			<p>A | No. But some people have said yes. I don't have much confident in my skills so you decide.</p>

			<h3>Q | Are you gay?</h3>
			<p>A | No I'm not (yet?). I'm just a femboy and it has nothing to do with my sexual orientation. It also has nothing to do with me being interested in computer science.</p>
