				Hi I'm Kiryuuin. You might know me from the remixes I posted on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KiryuuinNFB" class="walloftextlink" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>.
				I have been making music since grade 6 and I think I'm somewhat good at it. I usually do morlum, eurobeat, J-Pop and other genres I like listening to. You can commission me at the <a href="/commission" class="walloftextlink">commission page</a>.
				I'm also interested in programming, especially web development. although I'm not good at it, I am always looking for improvement. I also made <a href="https://github.com/KiryuuinNFB/Kafkarchive" class="walloftextlink" target="_blank">Kafkarchive</a>.
				A rough character build calculator and database for Honkai: Star Rail.

				Before this section ends I wanna tell you (the reader) that.
				Some stuff I've written in this website might seems nonsense or random unnecessary stuff.
				That's because even though I'm an introverted person, I do have a lot I wanna talk about and my website seems like a perfect place to do so.

				I'm currently studying in grade 12 and is looking to be a computer science major (Yes I'm a femboy but not because I like computers).
				I'm not really of a social person and I'm not really of an assertive person either. I mostly spend my time at home either playing video games or doing my hobbies that I stated eariler.
				I do really like cosplaying, Although I don't have much money for me to spend on it.
				That's all I want you to know about me.
